# Bad-Bank
This is my three-tier Bad Bank project. The goal of the Bad Bank is to demonstrate full stack functionality in a Node application that features a front end with multiple components as well as a MongoDB database and API. This project demonstrates how front and back end are connected in a simple banking website. It allows users to create an account, log in, deposit and withdraw money, and check their balance.

To install yourself, clone the repo, and run:
 npm install - to get all dependencies
 node index.js - to run the Node app
